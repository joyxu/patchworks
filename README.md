# Linux-WSL2 Patchworks

Here you can find patches to apply on Linux-WSL2 kernel sources (or any other Linux kernel sources targeting use on WSL2)
Browse the [branches](https://github.com/linux-wsl2/patchworks/branches) to see the list of patches

Most of the patches are not authored by Linux-WSL2, however we have modified the patch to work on Linux-WSL2 kernel sources properly
